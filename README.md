# local-web-suite
A local website to host interesting content

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a local website to host information I'm interested in.
The project is in a nascent stage, so what I have written below may change.

Here are some of the content I plan to incorporate:
* Live stock information of my portfolio (source from yahoo finance)
* Toronto weather
* Local news / meetup or volunteer opportunities
